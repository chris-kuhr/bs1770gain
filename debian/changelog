bs1770gain (0.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release (Closes: #781026).
  * Add 10-autotools.diff to provide and use autotools based build
    system instead of the original one to avoid trying to download
    libraries from the net and use the system libraries instead.
  * Add 20-disable-dynload.diff to disable dynamic loading of shared
    libraries, and leave it to the linker at compile time.
  * Add autopkgtest script to check that the program is able to
    process a simple WAV file.
